# Bucket List Application


What would you like to do in the next few years? Climb a mountain? Learn to ride a bike? :) Itâ€™s
important to keep track of what you have already done and what you are yet to achieve. In the
next steps, we will work towards building a bucket list application that helps us record activities
we wish to undertake, tick off what we have done and even invite our friends to have fun with us.
